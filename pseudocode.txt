factors affecting jumpshot:
- knee angle, hip angle, elbow angle
    - load point, set point
    - ball doesn't move too far backwards at set point
- joint extension (full extension)
- arm/leg synchronisation (one motion/two motion)
    - tracking this: relative position to each other (magnitude between vector points)
- hip/knee synchronisation


- track shooting side (right markers)
    - velocity? acceleration?
