factors affecting jumpshot:
- knee angle, hip angle, elbow angle
    - load point, set point
    - ball doesn't move too far backwards at set point
- joint extension (full extension)
- synchronisation
    - arm/leg synchronisation (one motion/two motion)
        - tracking this: relative position to each other (magnitude between vector points)
    - hip/knee synchronisation
    - plot angular velocity of knee, hips, elbow matplotlib


- track shooting side (right markers)

- joint triplets to take note
    - shoulder elbow wrist (elbow angle) (SEW)
    - hip knee ankle (knee angle) (HKA)
    - knee hip shoulder (hip angle) (KHS)
    - hip shoulder elbow (armpit angle) (HSE)

        - armpit angle should not be increasing after full extension of lower body (HKA, KHS, HSE)
        - one-motion/two-motion detection (armpit angle zero angular velocity, jump then release or jump + release)

        - if value is more than x SDs, ignore value and take average of values before and after
            - deviation from the path? regression
